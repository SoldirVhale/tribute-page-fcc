        <p id="description">J. Robert Oppenheimer, often dubbed the "father of the atomic bomb," was a pivotal figure in 20th-century science and politics. As the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer oversaw the development of the atomic bomb, a creation that would forever alter global diplomacy and warfare. His subsequent years were marked by his contributions to nuclear policy and his philosophical reflections on science and society.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education and Early Career</strong><br> Oppenheimer was educated at Harvard, Cambridge, and GÃ¶ttingen, becoming a distinguished theoretical physicist with contributions to quantum mechanics and astrophysics.</li>
                <li><strong>The Manhattan Project</strong><br> In 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project. Under his leadership, the project developed and tested the first atomic bombs in 1945.</li>
                <li><strong>Trinity Test</strong><br> On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was detonated at the Trinity site in New Mexico, marking a monumental achievement in science and engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-War Years</strong><br> After the war, Oppenheimer became a chief advisor to the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission, where he advocated for international control of nuclear power.</li>
                <li><strong>McCarthy Era Challenges</strong><br> During the 1950s, Oppenheimer faced significant political scrutiny over his earlier leftist associations and his stance on limiting nuclear arms, leading to a public hearing that stripped him of his security clearance.</li>
