        <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer, often dubbed the "father of the atomic bomb," was a pivotal figure in 20th-century science and politics. As the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer oversaw the development of the atomic bomb, a creation that would forever alter global diplomacy and warfare. His subsequent years were marked by his contributions to nuclear policy and his philosophical reflections on science and society.</p>
